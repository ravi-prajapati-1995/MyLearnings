Given an unsorted array with positive and negative integers we need to find perfect pairs
A pair of integers (x,Y) is perfect if below conditions will be satisfied:

1. min(|x-y|, |x+y|) <= min(|x|, |y|)
2. max(|x-y|, |x+y|) >= max(|x|, |y|)

Find the numbers of perfect pairs (arr[i], arr[j]) where 0 <= i < j < n

Example: arr = [2, 5, -3]
Output: 3 because the possible pairs that satisfy condition are: (2, 5), (2, -3) and (5, -3)

Job Scheduling:

There are m jobs to schedule on n processors.
A schedule is balanced if the difference between the number of jobs scheduled on any two neighboring processors does not exceed 1.

The kth processor is the most efficient, and thus, the maximum number of jobs should be scheduled on that processor.
Find the maximum number of jobs that can be scheduled on the kth processor, such that the overall schedule remains balanced.

Note: Each processor must have at least one job scheduled.
Example

Consider n = 5, m = 11, k = 3.

Consider the following job schedules:

Schedule	Is balanced?	Jobs scheduled on the kth processor
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]	No	-
[1, 2, 3, 3, 2]	Yes	3

I am having a list of strings: cat, atc, tac, dog, god, odg, ac, ca
Using stream need to distinguse like cat, atc, tac in one list and dog, god, odg in another
in one go ac and ca in another list
