 * You are given an undirected graph consisting of V vertices and E edges represented by a list edges[][], along with an integer m.
 * Your task is to determine whether it is possible to color the graph using at most m different colors such that no two
 * adjacent vertices share the same color. Return true if the graph can be colored with at most m colors, otherwise return false.
