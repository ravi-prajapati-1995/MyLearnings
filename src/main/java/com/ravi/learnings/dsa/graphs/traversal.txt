To traverse any graph we have two approaches:
BFS : Breadth First Search
DFS: Depth First Search

                   (1)
                  /    \
                (2)      (6)
               /  \      / \
             (3)  (4)   (7) (9)
                   |     |
                  (5)---(8)
BFS: In BFS or level wise traversal we will have a starting node, and then from that starting node we need to traverse
graph level wise i.e
if Starting node is 1 so we start from 1 and it will be level-0
level-0 --- 1
level-1 --- 2, 6
level-2 --- 3, 4, 7, 9
level-3 --- 5, 8

Note: On level 0 there can be only 1 node
if starting node is 6 then
level-0 --- 6
level-1 --- 1, 7, 9 (from 6, 1 is on level 1 and 7, 9 also level 1)
level-2 --- 2, 8
level-3 --- 3, 4, 5

To traverse the graph we need a visited array that will be size of N+1 where n is the edges, if we traversed a node
we will mark that position 1
