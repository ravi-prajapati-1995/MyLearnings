/**
 * https://takeuforward.org/plus/dsa/problems/convert-min-heap-to-max-heap
 * Given a min-heap in array representation named nums, convert it into a max-heap and return the resulting array.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A min-heap is a complete binary tree where the key at the root is the minimum among all keys present in a binary min-heap and the same property is recursively true for all nodes in the Binary Tree.
 * <p>
 * A max-heap is a complete binary tree where the key at the root is the maximum among all keys present in a binary max-heap and the same property is recursively true for all nodes in the Binary Tree.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Since there can be multiple answers, the compiler will return true if it's correct, else false.
 * Input: nums = [10, 20, 30, 21, 23]
 *
 * Output: [30, 21, 23, 10, 20]
