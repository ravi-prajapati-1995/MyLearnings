To know about the heap we should know about the: Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

Binary Tree: Where each node is having at most 2 child node is called binary tree.
Complete Binary Tree: A tree which has exact two nodes for each node except the last node.

Almost Complete Binary Tree: It is the tree which follows the below two conditions.
1. All the nodes except last and second last node have two elements
2. The last level is filled from left to right, i.e If in last level we have 4 nodes A, B, C, D
First we will add child with A, then with B and so on
We can't have child like 1 at A then 2nd with B or C or D
          17
       /       \
     16         14
    /  \       /
   13  11    10
  /
 8



Heap: Heap is a special tree based DS with satisfy heap property.
Types of Heap:
1. Max-Heap: In max heap largest element at the root and all the child element is <= to the root node
             19
           /     \
         17       16
        /  \     /  \
       13  11  10   8
      / \
     7   6
In above example you can see 19 is the largest element and all there elements <= to the root, if we see 16 sub-tree same
property applies to that too

2. Min-Heap: In min heap we have smallest element at the top and all the child are greater than the root node at
    any level

               2
            /     \
          5         7
        /   \     /
       10   12   15
At any subtree root node is smaller than the child node

Why we are representing heaps with almost complete binary tree?
Almost complete binary tree has property where we start filling nodes from left to right, in min-heap example
7 has node 15 in its left side, according to that property this can't be in right side where left side is empty.
So this property help us to determine the next children of any node as we store this in array
i.e
    Left child = 2 * idx + 1
    Right child = 2 * idx + 2

 2 5 7 10 12 15
 if we are at 5 which at index 1 its left child will be on 3, right 4 and this is true for all the elements

 To find the parent of any child idx = ceil(idx/2) - 1
 i.e if we are at 15 index 6 parent will be ceil(6/2) - 1 --> 3-1 = 2

 No of internal nodes: In complete binary tree number of internal nodes are calculated by below formula, internal nodes
 are the nodes which are not leaf nodes.
 internal nodes = No. of leaf nodes - 1

Index of leaf nodes take the below example:
              19
           /     \
         17       16
        /  \     /  \
       13  11  10   8
      / \
     7   6

Above tree has 9 nodes in above tree leaf nodes are: 11 10 8 7 6
which starts from the index: 5 6 7 8 9
Leaf nodes are start from:  n/2 --- till n-1 where n is the number of nodes

in our case n = 9 (0 based index) 9/2 -- 9-1 --> 4 --- 8

 Index of internal node = 0 --- N/2 - 1
 as from N/2 leaf node start so internal nodes which are note leaf node
