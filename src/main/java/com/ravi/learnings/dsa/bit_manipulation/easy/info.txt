when we write  int x = 13 , then computer don't understand decimal thing it only understands binary and its stores 1101
as int is 32 bits, so it in last four bits it stores 1101 and remaining 28 bits it stores 0

when we print x then computer convert this binary into decimal no behind the scene

1s complement: fliping the bits called 1s compelemtn
    let take example of 13 = b(1101), here b() this is binary of 13,
    then flip the 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s so it will become 0010 so 1s complement of 13 is 0010

2s complement:
    1. Figure out the 1s complement of the given no.
    2. Add 1 to it

 13s 2s compelment is --> 0011, 13 -> b(1101) ---1s complement--> 0010  --- Adding 1 --> 0011
