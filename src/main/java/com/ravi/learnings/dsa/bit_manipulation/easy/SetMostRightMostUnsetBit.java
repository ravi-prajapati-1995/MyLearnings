 * Given a non-negative number n . The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of n.
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.
 *
 * Input: n = 15
 * Output: 31
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is 01111. After setting right most bit it becomes 11111 which is 31.
