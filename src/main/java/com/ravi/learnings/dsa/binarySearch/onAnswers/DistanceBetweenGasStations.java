 * <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station/0">here</a>
 * We have a horizontal number line. On that number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[n-1],
 * where n is the size of the stations array. Now, we add k more gas stations so that d, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations,
 * is minimized. We have to find the smallest possible value of d. Find the answer exactly to 2 decimal places.
 * Note: stations is in a strictly increasing order.
 * <p>
 * n = 4
 * stations[] = [1, 13, 17, 23]
 * k = 5
 * We need to place 4 station in between so that maximum distance between stations can be minimized
 * Current max gap is 12 between any two consecutive stations
 * Tip: we can't place elements beyond and before first and last element if we do that it will not the max gap for 1 and 13
 * So we need to place elements between elements
 * To do that we need to find out maximum gap between element and start putting station in between in above case max gap
 * in consecutive element is 13 - 1 = 12 so we will place one station there then arr will look like
 * stations[] = [1, '7' , 13, 17, 23] now we put a element at '7' place than max gap will be 6 which between 7 -1, 13-7, 23-17
 * now place second element between 17 and 23 to minimize gap
 * stations[] = [1, '7' , 13, 17, '20', 23] - now max gap is 6 between 7 -1 and 13 - 7 and we put 2 elements
 * stations[] = [1, '4', '7' , 13, 17, '20', 23] now max gap is 6 between 13 and 7
 * stations[] = [1, '4', '7', '10' , 13, 17, '20', 23] now max gap is 4 between 17 and 13 and we put 4 elements
 * stations[] = [1, '4', '7', '10' , 13, '15' 17, '20', 23] now max gap is 3 between 1, 4, 7 and 10 and we put all 5 elements
 * equals to k so our answer for this will be 3
