 * Given an array/list of length ‘n’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given
 * array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘k’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards.
 * Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.</br>
 * You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘n’ boards under a
 * constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.
 * Example :
 * Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], k = 2
 * Output: 11
