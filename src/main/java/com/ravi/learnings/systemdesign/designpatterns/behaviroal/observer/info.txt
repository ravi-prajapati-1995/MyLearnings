Observer Design Pattern:

There are two components in this pattern:
1. Observable : It is the object whenever there is change in its state then it will notify all the Observers
2. Observer: It will observe the state of observable and take step accordingly

Interface Observable {
    void add(Observer);
    void remove(Observer);
    void notify()
    void setData(data)
}

interface Observer() {
    void update();
}
