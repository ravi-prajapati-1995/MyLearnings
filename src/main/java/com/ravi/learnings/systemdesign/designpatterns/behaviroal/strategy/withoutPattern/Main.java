/**
 * In this code what problem we are facing is:
 * our SportsVehicle and OffRoadVehicle has same kind of functionality:
 * There is not way we can common this code so to resolve this issue we can use strategy design pattern
 * <p>
 * Currently there is only one method  drive which we have vehicle there may be case that we have multiple methods like:
 * display, noOfSeats, features there may be case that more than 1 child has same kind of code so there we have code
 * duplication problem.
 * <p>
 * So to avoid this code duplication we can use Strategy design pattern
