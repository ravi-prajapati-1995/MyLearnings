Chain of Responsibility:
Real World Analogy:
    Customer Care: You has a window computer and there is issue while boot up your computer, you called helpline
    phone number then:
    1. It will connect you with the computer which try to give solution of most famous issues.
    2. After your issue not listed on IVR, then transfer call to Customer care guys which give you some random solution
        and not worked in your case.
    3. After that they connected you with Engineer which gives you proper solution about drivers which needs to be installed

So above process is example of chain of responsibility where each layer has some responsibility and according to that they
try to provide solution till your issue is not resolved

Filter chaining is also an example of chain of responsibility where each filter has its own responsibility and accordingly
pass or block the request, if on filter block the request it will not traverse further
