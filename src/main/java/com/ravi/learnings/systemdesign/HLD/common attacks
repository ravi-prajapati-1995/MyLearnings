CSRF: Cross Site Request Forgery:

In this attack I am authenticated to a server i.e bank server and I had SESSION_ID in my browser
Then I clicked malicious link, then that website will make a request to the bank server, as my session id already
stored in the browser so browser will automatically add that session id ,
In this way attacker can do malicious activity

Steps:
1. User Should be logged in website and had a token
2. It is only applicable for statefull applications
3. When user click on third party app, then in background a request made to bank server without user notice
when sending request to bank server that is known to user so browser will automatically add cookie with the request
and request succeed

How to protect CSRF token:
By adding CSRF token in the requests So when we are submitting a form in along with data we will send CSRF token
that is received from the server for each request, so server will validate that CSRF token and after that it will proceed
