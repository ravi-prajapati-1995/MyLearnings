We have two types of graphs
1. Directed Graph : Directed graph where all edges are directed edges
 O--->O
 |    |
 v    v
 O--->O

2. Undirected Graph : In undirected graph edges are undirectional
 O---O
 |   |
 O---O
  \ /
   O

Cycles in graph: It is not necessary that all nodes should connected or have cycle to form a graph, if a structure
that is having edges and nodes, can called as graph, tree can also be graph as it has nodes and edges

If we start traversing from node and end at that node then it is called cycle in graph

Path: It contains multiple nodes/vertices and each of them are reachable.

Degree:
    Undirected Graph: No of nodes to which a node is connected known as degree, Total Degree = 2 * Edge
    Directional Graph:
        In-Degree: No of incoming edge to that particular node know and in degree
        out-Degree: No of outgoing edges from a node know as out degree

Edge Weight: When edges has value known as edge weight if not then we consider it as 1 for all

Representation of Graph:
    1. We can represent it via 2d matrix having a matrix [n+1, m+1] where n defines nodes and m define edges
    i.e if we have a unidirectional graph where 1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2->4, 3-> 5, 4->5
      1 ——  2
      |     |
      |     |
      3 ——  4
       \   /
         5

    above example is un-directional graph having 5 nodes(n) and 6 edges(m) so we will create a 2D matrix
    in question we will have m lines represents edges: In un directional graph [1 2] and [2 1] is same
    [1 2]
    [2 4]
    [1 3]
    [3 5]
    [3 4]
    [5 4]

This matrix will be represented by:
                  0   1   2   3   4   5
