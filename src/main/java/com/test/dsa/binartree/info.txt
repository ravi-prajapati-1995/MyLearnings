Tree DS:
It is the DS in which we store elements in hierarchical order ie.

Tree has three types:
1. BinaryTree -> A tree where a Node can have max of two children
2. Binary Search Tree
3. N-array Tree

Node: Node is where we store the data

      1
     / \
    5   6
   / \  / \
 10  6 2  3
          \
          12
In above tree we have 8 nodes, and each element is having at max 2 element so it is binary tree
Root: top level element where we start traversing
Children: for 1 node.  5 and 6 are children and 10, 6, 2, 3 are grand children
Parent: for 5 and 6, 1 is parent , for 10, 6 node 5 is parent and 1 is grand parent. For 2, 3
Ancestor: Anything that is above from that particular node is ancestor of that element for 12 node, 3, 6, 1 are ancestor
          for 2 node, 6 is ancestor

LeafNode: Any node which is having 0 child called leaf node 10, 6, 2 and 12 are leaf node
SubTree: Any tree that can be cut from tree is subtree in above example 5 10 6 is sub tree, 12 can be sub tree 3 12 is tree


Types of Binary Tree:
Full BT: All nodes have either 0 or 2 child elements
