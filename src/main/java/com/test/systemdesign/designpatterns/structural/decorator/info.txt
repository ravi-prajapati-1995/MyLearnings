Decorator Design Pattern:


When we have an object which can have multiple properties and each property is independent from each other.
i.e
Pizza: In pizza we have base on that base we can  add multiple things ie
        1. Topping
        2. Extra Veg
        3. Cheese
And so on here we can add multiple things independently we can have multiple toppings.
Here our base object is s same and we adding on multiple properties.

Coffee:
    Here we can customize it with multiple things like  we are having Latte
    1. we can add extra milk of soya milk , almond milk
    2. We can add extra suger


Dressing: Like we dress in winter
1. we wear thermals
2. on top of that we wear Shirt Pent
3. on that we can wear sweater
4. on that we can wear coat


Why we use decorator design pattern: To avoid class explosion
We need to create multiple classes which have properties in permuntation combination like in pizz
we need to create class base+extra veg, base + extra-veg + cheese,, base + cheese
when any new property came  then we need to create all combination
