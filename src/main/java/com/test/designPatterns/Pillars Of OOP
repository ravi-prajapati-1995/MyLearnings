1. Abstraction: Mean hiding, it is a modal of real-world object, Limited to a specific context, which
    represents all details relevant to this context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.

    I.e: we have Airplane class and there are multiple private methods(-) and only few public method(+)
        Airplane:
        -speed
        -altitude
        -pitchAngle
        -yawAngle
        --------------------
        + fly()

    In above example we exposed only fly() method to user they don't know about the internal details like
    speed, altitude etc..

2. Encapsulation: Meaning put the variable and method in single unit called class.
3. Polymorphism:
4. Inheritance
