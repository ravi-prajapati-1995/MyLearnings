1. Debug Challenge:
    If we have 3 microservices S1, S2 and S3 and  S1 is getting some data from S2 and S2 getting data from S3
    and we did some changing in response of S3
    Because of these changes in S3, S2 start breaking and due to s2, s1 also start breaking
    So for debug main cause all three microservice needs to evaluate who is causing issue

2. Loosely Coupled:
     Microservice should be loosely coupled so that if we scale s1 it should not impact any client of this microservices

3. Duplicate Code:
      There can be many classes that can be used in multiple microservices and many tables which many services needs frequently
