Abstract Factory:
It is the extension of factory design pattern, In this design pattern we will have multiple factory
i.e We have VehicleFactory and this is implemented by other factories

Like vehicle can be type of Car and Bike which are LandVehicle and Vehicle can be Boat and Ship which are WaterVehicle
So we will have two factory which give us vehicle based on type

i.e We have multiple car companies like: Tata, Mahindra, Maruti
and each car company made car in these category: Sedan, Hatchback, SUV

So we can create Vehicle factory and we ask that to create vehicle based on type like sedan, hatchback and SUV
Vehicle is also interface
interface VehicleFactory {
    Vehicle createVehicle(String type);
}
class LandVehicleFactory implements VehicleFactory
