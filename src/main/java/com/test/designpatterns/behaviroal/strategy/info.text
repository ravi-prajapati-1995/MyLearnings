Strategy Design Pattern:

This Pattern is used to remove code duplication if subclass of same level has same set of code i.e

We have vehicle class that is having drive() method
Vehicle class has 3 child classes NormalVehicle, SportsVehicle and OffRoadVehicle

Lets assume we have same set of functionality in SportsVehicle and offRoadVehicle and we are writing same set of code
in both the classes

Problem: We are repeating same code in OffRoadVehicle and SportsVehicle there is not way to remove it

Solution: We can create a another interface/Strategy DriveMode which can have 2 mode
